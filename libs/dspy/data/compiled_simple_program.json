        "question": "Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky.  Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald.  How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?",
        "rationale": "find the answer. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Then, we know that Reginald counted two fewer than Bridget, so he counted 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more than Reginald, so he counted 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars, we add up the total number of shooting stars (14+12+16=42) and divide by the number of people (3). This gives us an average of 14 shooting stars per person. Since Sam counted 16 shooting stars, he counted 2 more than the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them.",

        "rationale": "find out how many pencils Sarah has. First, we know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday, so she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. Then, on Wednesday she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, Sarah has a total of 38 + 54 = 92 pencils.",

Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes?",
